A repoitory for my smart thermostat/light controller to put in every room. can control every tasmota rgbw light (without hass for now)

Made with micropython to control thermostatic valves without cables because I can't fit them in walls, and to control the light bulb I put in my room by just pressing tangible stuff without taking out my phone or asking alexa
